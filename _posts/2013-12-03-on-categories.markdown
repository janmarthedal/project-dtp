title: On categories
categories: [information]
---
A category, as used on teoremer, can be seen as a [tag][1] with another category as parent. A special root tag is used to represent top-level categories and no cycles are allowed. This way all categories represent a rooted tree, or heirarchy, of tags.

Categories are useful for browsing or searching. Each tag may contain spaces and even inline math. For instance,
> `/` calculus `/` indefinite integrals `/` integrals involving {% inline_math \sqrt{a x + b} %}
is a valid category.
