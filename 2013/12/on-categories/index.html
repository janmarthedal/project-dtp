<p>A category, as used on teoremer, can be seen as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tag</a> with another category as parent. A special root tag is used to represent top-level categories and no cycles are allowed. This way all categories represent a rooted tree, or heirarchy, of tags.</p>

<p>Categories are useful for browsing or searching. Each tag may contain spaces and even inline math. For instance,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>/</code> calculus <code>/</code> indefinite integrals <code>/</code> integrals involving (\sqrt{a x + b} )
is a valid category.</p>
