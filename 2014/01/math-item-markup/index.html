The markup to use when editing math items is based on <a title="Markdown" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>. All the markup of Markdown is supported, except for inline HTML, links and images.

<h3>Basics</h3>
A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines.

Words can be in <em>italics</em> or <strong>boldface</strong> by using <code>*single asterisks*</code> or <code>**double asterisks**</code><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, respectively.</span>

Section headers can be written as
<pre><code># This is a level 1 header

</code><code>## This is a level 2 header

</code><code>###### This is a level 6 header</code></pre>
where one to six hash characters determine the header level.

Lists can be written as
<pre>* Item one
* Item two
* Item three</pre>
or using numbering,
<pre>1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three</pre>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
Mathematics can be included like it would be in a (La)TeX document using $-signs. This includes inline math
<pre>this formula $e^{-x^2}$ is an example of inline math</pre>
which will render as
<blockquote>this formula \(e^{-x^2} \) contains inline math</blockquote>
and display math
<pre>... from which we obtain
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^2}
$$
for positive $n$.</pre>
which will render as
<blockquote>... from which we obtain

\[\sum_{k=1}^n \]

for positive \(n \).</blockquote>
<h3>References</h3>
References to other math items can be inserted using <code>[@T3456]</code> or <code>[Text to display@T3456]</code>. Both examples will link to item "T3456", but the displayed link text will be <em>abcd</em> and <em>Text to display</em>, respectively.

Abstract definitions can be referenced as <code>[#bounded set]</code> or <code>[bounded#bounded set]</code>. Both examples will link to a definition <a href="http://blog.teoremer.com/2013/12/03/on-categories.html">category</a> through the keyword <em>bounded set</em>, but the displayed text will be <em>bounded set</em> and <em>bounded</em>, respectively.
<h3>Media</h3>
Media can be inserted using <code>[!M1234]</code> or <code>[Figure 1!M1243]</code>. Both examples will link to the media item "M1234", but the displayed link text will be <em>M1234</em> and <em>Figure 1</em>, respectively.
